# NoDropItem

A PocketMine-MP plugin to prevent players from dropping items from their inventory.

## Why so Different?

This plugin was originally closed source. But because it is no longer used, I decided to open source the plugin.

I'm planning to license (GPL v3) the plugin in the coming weeks.
